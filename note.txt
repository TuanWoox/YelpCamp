<input type="text" id="title" name="campground[title]">
=> this is used to group content together under campground when we send the form
render => is used to render things in views
redirect => is used to change the website link not the views

SECTION 41: 
ejs-mate is a tool helps us to create boilerplate tempalte ( a level up compare to partial)
//We dont need to back away, just specify which folder the layout in!
<% layout('layouts/boilerplate') -%>
//We need to back away if that is in another folder
includeing partial: <%- include('../partials/navbar') %>
difference between partial and ejs-mate:
With partials, you add the whole block at once, without customizing it; layout on the other hand lets you customize the text within that boilerplate, not only add it.
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4"> => take 1/3 of the row


SECTION 43:
<form class="row g-3 needs-validation" novalidate>
=>For custom Bootstrap form validation messages, youâ€™ll need to add the novalidate boolean attribute to your <form>. This disables the browser default feedback tooltips, but still provides access to the form validation APIs in JavaScript
Adding: Utils with 2 js file is CatchAsyncs ( helping us to catch async error) and ExpressError (our custom defining error class)
Adding: Error template
Adding: validateSchema ( this is a joi schema for detecting error pattern in javascript)
The app.get('*') doesnt conflict with the app.use to handle error! Because when we throw an error =>
it will look for app.use with 4 parameter!!!
JOI : a JavaScript validating tool
//Explain for this code: First we pass in a object ( that is request.body) => in that request.body
it must have campground ( is also a object)!
const campgroundSchema =Joi.object({
        campground: Joi.object({
            title: Joi.string().require(),
            price: Joi.number().required().min(0),
            location: Joi.string().required(),
            description: Joi.string().required()
        }).require()
    })

THE IMAGE EXPLAINATION:
-We dont get new images for the index show page because the cache of the browser and the link block us from getting new image everytime!

SECTION 46:
module.exports.reviewSchema = Joi.object({
    review: Joi.object({
        rating: Joi.number().required().min(1).max(5),
        body: Joi.string().required()
    }).required()
})
If we dont have .required() the whole object => the validation will still pass if the review object is missing


SECTION49:
express router would like to keep param seperately, like the param in the prefix 
wont be in the route file => to have that => we need to specify an option
mergeParams : true
The purpose of serving static file:
These things are to be made available publicly because the browser should be able to access it and process in client side. so for this and images, css, js and docs as well, we use public fonder.

or putting it simple, those static (constant) files which are accessed by the browser (not server) are kept in the public directory.

Note If both expires and maxAge are set in the options, then the last one defined in the object is what is used.
Note The expires option should not be set directly; instead only use the maxAge option.

The connect-flash middleware is used to store flash messages in the session, which are then accessible in the req.flash object. When you configure connect-flash in your main app.js file and add it to your Express app, it makes the flash functionality available throughout your application, including in your routers.
By setting up express-session and connect-flash in app.js, every request passing through your application has access to req.flash. This includes requests handled by routers defined in separate files.

Flash is depended upon sessions, because it stores information in session. => 

Yes, you need to install and use express-session alongside connect-flash in a Node.js application.
