<input type="text" id="title" name="campground[title]">
=> this is used to group content together under campground when we send the form
render => is used to render things in views
redirect => is used to change the website link not the views

SECTION 41: 
ejs-mate is a tool helps us to create boilerplate tempalte ( a level up compare to partial)

//We dont need to back away, just specify which folder the layout in!
<% layout('layouts/boilerplate') -%>

//We need to back away if that is in another folder
includeing partial: <%- include('../partials/navbar') %>

difference between partial and ejs-mate:
With partials, you add the whole block at once, without customizing it; layout on the other hand lets you customize the text within that boilerplate, not only add it.


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4"> => take 1/3 of the row
